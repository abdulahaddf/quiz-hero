              <h2 class="card-title">Difference of map filter foreach and find</h2>
              <p>1.Map: A map function is a function that applies a given function to each element of a collection (e.g., an array) and returns a new collection with the results. The new collection has the same length as the original one, but each element is transformed by the given function. <br>

                2.Filter: A filter function is a function that takes a collection (e.g., an array) and a predicate function, and returns a new collection that contains only the elements that satisfy the predicate. In other words, the filter function "filters out" the elements that don't match the given criteria. <br>
                
                3.Find: A find function is a method or function that searches a collection (e.g., an array) for an element that satisfies a given condition, and returns the first matching element. If no element matches the condition, the function returns null or undefined. <br>
                
                4.ForEach: A forEach method is a function that iterates over a collection (e.g., an array) and applies a given function to each element, but it does not create a new collection. Instead, it performs some action (e.g., logging, updating a variable) on each element.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Difference of LocalStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies</h2>
              <p>1.LocalStorage: LocalStorage is a type of web storage that allows you to store key/value pairs in the user's web browser with no expiration date. The data stored in LocalStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, and can be accessed by any script running on the same origin (i.e., the same protocol, hostname, and port). <br>

                2.SessionStorage: SessionStorage is a type of web storage that allows you to store key/value pairs in the user's web browser for a single session (i.e., as long as the browser is open and the user is browsing your website). The data stored in SessionStorage is cleared when the browser is closed, and can only be accessed by scripts running on the same page or in iframes of that page. <br>
                
                3.Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer by the web server. Cookies can be used to store user preferences, login credentials, and other data that needs to persist across different sessions or different websites. Cookies can also be used for tracking purposes by third-party advertisers. Cookies can be set with an expiration date or can be session cookies, which are cleared when the browser is closed.

              <h2 class="card-title">What is event loop & how it works?</h2>
              <p>The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows for the asynchronous execution of code. <br>

                At a high level, the event loop is a mechanism that JavaScript uses to manage the execution of code. When a script is executed, it is processed line-by-line by the JavaScript engine. However, some operations in JavaScript are non-blocking, meaning that they do not wait for a result before moving on to the next line of code. These non-blocking operations, like I/O operations or setTimeout, are instead passed off to the browser or operating system to be executed asynchronously. <br>
                
                The event loop is a loop that constantly checks the execution stack and the message queue for new messages to execute. When the execution stack is empty, the event loop will take the first message from the message queue and push it onto the execution stack, where it will be executed. This process repeats as long as there are messages in the queue. <br>
                
                The event loop is what allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the execution of other code. It enables the efficient handling of I/O operations, animations, and other asynchronous tasks in web applications.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">What does the function quizTimer do?</h2>
              <p>The quizTimer function in noChange js file takes a single parameter dismiss. It sets up an interval that runs every second (1000 milliseconds) and updates the value of an HTML element with the ID count. <br>

                If the dismiss parameter is truthy (i.e., not null, undefined, false, 0, NaN, or an empty string), the interval is cleared and the function returns. <br>
                
                Otherwise, on each interval tick, the function calculates the number of minutes and seconds that have passed (covtMin and mod, respectively), and formats them into a string in the format "mm:ss". It then updates the text content of the HTML element with the calculated value, along with a "sec" subscript. <br>
                
                The function also adds a class (text-red-700 or text-red-300) to the element every other second to create a flashing effect.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">What does the function chooseQuiz do?</h2>
              <p>The chooseQuiz function in noChange js file takes two parameters: index and givenAns. The function modifies the global variable answers, which is an array that contains objects representing the user's answers to a quiz. <br>

                The function first checks if an answer object for the quiz at the given index already exists in the answers array. It does this by using the find method to search for an object in answers with an id property equal to the id property of the quiz object at the given index in quizData. If an object is found, the function updates the givenAns property of that object to the value of the givenAns parameter. <br>
                
                If an object is not found, the function creates a new object that combines the quiz object at the given index in quizData with the givenAns parameter, and pushes this new object to the answers array. <br>
                 
                Finally, the function calls a displayAnswers function with the answers array as an argument, which presumably updates the display of the user's answers.</p>
